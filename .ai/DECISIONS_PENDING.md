# Decisions Pending

No architecture decision is currently blocked.

RFC-0001 resolves the M7 first-native-kernel question by deferring Rust/PyO3
until its quantified cross-platform, buffer/GIL, ownership, build, fallback,
fuzz, and maintenance-owner gate is satisfied.

ADR-0023 resolves the M8 SDL3 question by using the already-pinned GLFW gamepad
surface and deferring SDL3 until a stable Python binding, auditable offline
binary delivery, explicit lifecycle ownership, cross-platform conformance, and
maintenance owner are evidenced.

ADR-0024 resolves the M9 Box2D question by deferring the preview binding until
the complete CPython/OS wheel and provenance matrix, stable API, lifecycle and
stale-object soak, documented GIL/thread ownership, cross-platform
snapshot/replay classification, copied engine adapter conformance, and a named
maintenance owner are evidenced.

ADR-0025 resolves the M10 inspector boundary with one isolated, owned local
MCP child, detached semantic observations, explicit receipted writes, exact
hash continuity, and no arbitrary process, network, remote-attach, or editor
surface.

Operational follow-ups outside repository implementation:

- Verify and reserve the `ludoweave` package name before the first publication.
